The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.  It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS. The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc., but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

# Simple Data -edX, University of Brtish Columbia

The goal of the Simple Data class is learn techniques to
1)  produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later
2)  make programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process

## Final project
Developed a the Game Space invaders by strictly following the **test-driven** and **clean code** approach taught in the course.

In particular, I payed attention to
1) Defined the problem domain making sketches.
2) Defined constants.
3) Defined and documented variables (signature, purpose, examples, stub) 
   and created corresponding function templates.
4) Defined the main function.
5) Defined functions and helpers by paying attention to the "one-task-per-function"- rules.
6) Strictly implemented tests before each function.

**Additional learnings:** DrRacket, Beginning Student Language (BSL), Visual Programming, Functional Programming, Natural Recursion, Primitive Data types, Arbitrary Sized Data Types, Structs.

### Play Space Invaders:
1) Download DrRacket: https://racket-lang.org/download/
2) Download space-invaders-starter.rkt from this repo. 
3) Choose Beginning Student Language from the Menu in DrRacket.
3) Click on run in the upper right corner to check if tests pass.
4) To play type (main G0) in the console and hit enter.
5) Press let-key or right-key to move. Press space-key to shoot.
